<center> <strong> Bangladesh Education</strong> </center>
<p>The largest issue for the education system in Bangladesh is lack of quality. Overcrowding and under-qualified instructors have led to high dropout rates at the primary and secondary levels.
 In fact, while primary enrollment may be at 98%, it drops substantially to 22% at the higher secondary level. This is especially evident in rural communities where various social and economic 
 factors can prevent safe access to education things like natural disasters, child labor, family poverty, disability, gender abuse, child marriage, and poor sanitation.Currently,
 the government main goals are to expand learning opportunities at earlier ages, offer more inclusive education, and provide increased access to education for adolescents.

                             <strong>What university should I go to to become an engineer?</strong> 


Some things to consider when choosing what university to study your engineering degree:

 1.Think about where in the UK you would like to study; you'll be here for a while, so picking a location that works best for you is important

  2.Check university websites for more details on the courses; what modules are studied? How long for? Do you find the course content interesting?

    3.Attend an open day (virtual or in-person), if you can, to get a feel for the university and whether it would be a good fit for you

      4.Look at the university rankings for computer science and filter by preferences that matter to you.
